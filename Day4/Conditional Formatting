the day was for conditional formatting. I Apply conditional formatting to highlight cells with high sales values. Indicate what i also think is a high sales value for me.


In this dataset, the average sales value is $322.97 and the highest sales value is $1042.65, therefore I would consider a high sales value to be starting from anything above average.
